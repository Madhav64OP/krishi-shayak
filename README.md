## üí° Project Overview

*KRISHI SAHAYAK* is an integrated AI agentic platform designed to empower Indian farmers. Our solution aims to address the challenges faced by farmers by providing a unified, multilingual, and intuitive interface that combines essential agricultural information with real-time AI assistance. The platform simplifies access to government schemes, weather forecasts, market updates, and disease detection, all within a single application.

The core innovation lies in creating a unified, *agentic platform* that automates and streamlines critical agricultural tasks, eliminating the need for farmers to use multiple tools. For example, the AI can detect a plant disease from an image and then intelligently suggest an appointment with a specialist, thereby connecting information to action.

## ‚öô Technical Stack

Our solution is built using a robust and modern stack designed for scalability and performance.

| Category | Technologies | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Frontend* | React, Node.js | Provides a user-friendly interface with multi-language support. |
| *Backend* | FastAPI, Uvicorn | A lightweight and high-performance backend for handling API requests. |
| *Agent Orchestration* | *LangChain, **LangGraph* | LangChain provides the modular components, while LangGraph orchestrates a stateful, multi-step agent workflow. |
| *LLM Integration* | *LangChain-Groq* | Connects the application to Groq's LPU-powered models for extremely fast, low-latency responses. |
| *Tooling* | *LangChain-Tavily, **DuckDuckGo-Search, **MCP Server* | Gives the agent access to real-time web search and external tools like our weather and disease models. |
| *ML Models* | *Gemma, **LLaMA-3* (fine-tuned), *Deep Learning* (for disease detection) | The AI's intelligence is powered by fine-tuned large language models and a custom deep learning model. |
| *Utilities* | python-dotenv, typing-extensions, Ipython | Standard Python libraries for managing environment variables and development. |

## üìà Success Metrics

Our success will be measured by:

  * *Engagement Frequency*: The number of times farmers use key features.
  * *Accuracy of Disease Detection*: The performance of our AI model.
  * *Language Coverage*: The number of supported local languages.
  * *Economic Impact*: The positive effect on crop yield and selling price.

## üìö Datasets

The disease detection model was trained and evaluated using the following datasets:

  * [New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset?select=New+Plant+Diseases+Dataset%28Augmented%29)
  * [20k Multi-class Crop Disease Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadali1045/20k-multi-class-crop-disease-images)
